# ICS to Apple Reminders

I regularly use Apple Reminders to keep track of my school assignments, sadly it does not support importing anything, so I have to manually import all my assignments.

**In progress project** to take any ICS file and import it into Apple Reminders

Likely will need to use EventKit and Swift, don't know those yet so it may take a while.

## Current progress made

* Built ICS parser which takes in ICS url and outputs as JSON format

## Todo

* Implement EventKit for use with Apple Reminders
* Likely will rebuilt ICS parser in Swift
